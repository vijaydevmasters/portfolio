                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an AI enthusiast with a strong foundation in robotics, machine learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs). My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with expertise in transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, natural language processing, and multimodal learning. I have applied these concepts in various projects using tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, ROS2, and Hugging Face, along with Python and C/C++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I work as a Research Assistant at the Fischell Department of Bioengineering, University of Maryland, where I contribute to a project modernizing oyster farming. I implemented YOLOv8 for dredger detection and later upgraded it to RT-DETR, improving IoU by 6%. Iâ€™m also developing a human pose detection system using MMPose to classify walking styles, showcasing my ability to apply LLMs in real-world scenarios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously, as a Machine Learning Engineer at Sai Vamsi Industries, I developed a YOLOv5-based classification pipeline to streamline press component sorting, significantly improving accuracy and efficiency. This role strengthened my practical skills in model development, deployment, and optimization in an industrial environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My LLM-focused projects include Adaptive Text-to-Command Translation for Robot Navigation, where I fine-tuned a T5-small transformer to achieve perfect test accuracy. By integrating LoRA, I reduced training parameters by 99.64% while maintaining 98.5% accuracy, enabling a TurtleBot3 to navigate autonomously. Additionally, I developed a Multimodal Alignment Model for LiDAR and Image Data using Q-Former to align point cloud and image data, enhancing perception performance. In my AI Learns to Play Mario project, I implemented a DQN with a SWIN Transformer, achieving a 500-moving average reward of 2700 within 1250 episodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These experiences have sharpened my skills in developing, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs across applications such as environmental monitoring, industrial automation, and robotics navigation. I am driven to continue applying advanced machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems.
